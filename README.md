### User Stories and Demands

#### First-time User

1. As a completely new user and non-Muslim I want to understand what the website is about and what I can expect to be tested on.
2. As a new user I want to know how to play the quiz.
3. I'd like to easily navigate across a clean and friendly user interface.
4. I'd like to have the option to contact the author of the webpage on his socials for any inquiries or potential problems.
5. I want to access the leaderboards and see who I'm squaring up against before I commit.
6. As a first time user and a layman Muslim I'd like to test my knowledge on the foundations of the religion to refresh my memory.

#### Returning User

7. As a returning user and a student of knowledge, I'd like to access the leaderboards and see if anyone has gotten ahead of me since I last played.
8. As a returning user I'd like to test myself on an intermediate difficulty topic, such as Islamic history.
9. As a returning user and a dedicated student of knowledge, I'd like to test my wits in a difficult quiz, such as the intricacies of Furu al-Fiqh.
10. I'd like to contact the webpage creator through his socials in order to give him some of my ideas for improvements to the website.

#### Webpage Owner

13. As the owner of the website, I want the users to have an easy way to contact me with any queries through the hyperlink-based icons to my socials in the footer of the website.
14. I want the students to compete against each other in all three quizzes and, as such, I'd like to have a leaderboard for every difficulty of the game.
15. I'd like the users to have a good experience viewing the webpage, so I'd like to make sure the website follows good UX design principles, is easy on the eyes and incorporates full interactivity of each page and button.

## Design of the Website

### Design Choices

The webpage was designed with the idea of a seaside marina restaurant in mind. The general aesthetic of the website is meant to be clean, organized and easily navigatable. The content of the webpage is neatly divided among sections and sub-sections to make the experience easy on the customer.

### Colour and Fonts

![Image of Adobe Color Wheel](docs/features/adobe-color-wheel.png)

Colour tones associated with the sea were chosen as basis for the colour palette of the webpage as the website is meant to emulate the vibe of a seaside marina. As such, the main colour is turquoise and the font colour is navy, which works well with the restaurant logo as well. For the fonts I chose Open Sans and Source Sans Pro from Google Fonts because they compliment one another very effectively. Arial was chosen as the backup font in case the previous two refuse to load because it's a neat, basic font that will display without any issues on all devices and software.

### Structure

The website is structured in a user friendly way that makes navigation of its contents extremely easy and pleasing to the eye. The most vital of information which can be stored on one page (*Home, About and Contact*) is done so through a hyperlink connection and relevant information in the webpage's footer section. Other equally vital information which need its own respective pages are stored in the *Gallery* and *Menu and Amenities* pages. As such, the website consists of three separate pages:
* **The Home Page**, with its About and Contact sections down the bottom of the page which can be accessed with just one click
* **The Gallery Page**, with its responsive gallery to enhance a customer's experience and give a glimpse into the restaurant facilities
* **The Menu and Amenities Page**, which stores both the menu and the room rental sections
