### User Stories and Demands

#### First-time User

1. As a completely new user and non-Muslim I want to understand what the website is about and what I can expect to be tested on.
2. As a new user I want to know how to play the quiz.
3. I'd like to easily navigate across a clean and friendly user interface.
4. I'd like to have the option to contact the author of the webpage on his socials for any inquiries or potential problems.
5. I want to access the leaderboards and see who I'm squaring up against before I commit.
6. As a first time user and a layman Muslim I'd like to test my knowledge on the foundations of the religion to refresh my memory.

#### Returning User

7. As a returning user and a student of knowledge, I'd like to access the leaderboards and see if anyone has gotten ahead of me since I last played.
8. As a returning user I'd like to test myself on an intermediate difficulty topic, such as Islamic history.
9. As a returning user and a dedicated student of knowledge, I'd like to test my wits in a difficult quiz, such as the intricacies of Furu al-Fiqh.
10. I'd like to contact the webpage creator through his socials in order to give him some of my ideas for improvements to the website.
11. I'd like to refresh my memory on how to play the game as I haven't been on the website in a few weeks.
12. I want to see a list of reputable scholars, imams and speakers to take from and improve my previous high score.

#### Webpage Owner

13. As the owner of the website, I want the users to have an easy way to contact me with any queries through the hyperlink-based icons to my socials in the footer of the website.
14. I want the students to compete against each other in all three quizzes and, as such, I'd like to have a leaderboard for every difficulty of the game.
15. I'd like the users to have a good experience viewing the webpage, so I'd like to make sure the website follows good UX design principles, is easy on the eyes and incorporates full interactivity of each page and button.

## Design of the Website

### Design Choices

The webpage was designed with the concept of an Islamic center of education in mind, hence its name - *'Talib al-Ilm'* which translates to *'Student of Knowledge'*. The chosen artistic direction is meant to be clean, organized and easily navigable. The content of the webpage is neatly divided between collapsible and interactive buttons as well as a point-and-click quiz to make the experience easy on experienced and inexperienced web users.

### Colour and Fonts

![Image of Coolors Color Wheel](docs/colourpalette.png)

Colour tones associated with Islam were chosen as basis for the colour palette of the webpage. As such, the main colour is black, which has been reported to be worn in many authentic ahadith by the Prophet Muhammad SAW and the Sahaba. Despite white being the second most authentic colour of Islam, I opted for *"Blanched Almond"* and *"Bisque"* to be the secondary colours, as this combination is more pleasing to the eye and still invokes feelings of Islam and many masajid in the Muslim world. Nevertheless, I also decided to include small hints of white, specifically in the quiz questions, to pay homage to that fact. For the fonts I chose Robot and Montserrat because they effectively compliment one another and are very clean. Sans-Serif was chosen as the backup font in case the previous two refuse to load because it's a basic font that should display without any issues on all devices and software.

### Structure

The website is structured in a user friendly way that makes navigation of its contents extremely easy and makes it pleasing to the eye. The *Home Page* serves as the central hub of the design, allowing for quick access to other sections of the project through fully interactive buttons. Available quizzes are stored in the *Foundations of Deen*, *Islamic History* and *Fiqh* pages. The grades for enrolled students are in *Student Grades* and a list of reputable scholars, imams and speakers is provided in the *Shuyookh, A'imma and Du'aah* section. As such, the website consists of five separate pages:
* **The Home Page**, with its selection of buttons and a collapsible section which explains how to use the webpage
* **Foundations of Deen**, with its easy difficulty ten question quiz on the foundations of the religion
* **Islamic History**, with its intermediate difficulty twenty question quiz on the history of Islam and Muslims
* **Fiqh**, with its hard difficulty ten question quiz on the ins and outs of Islamic jurisprudence
* **Student Grades**, with its list of enrolled students to compare yourself to once you get your grade
* **Shuyookh, A'imma and Du'aah**, with its selection of reputable scholars, imams and speakers.

### Features Left to Implement

In the future I plan on adding a fully dynamic student grades system to function as an authentic leaderboard where you can input your results, which I couldn't do now as I ran out of time with my project. I've also been considering adding a descrete music player to be activated by the user that would play authentic Islamic anasheed with vocals only.
